## Research Interests

- Environmental Economics
- International Trade
- Urban and Spatial Economics

**My primary research focus**, which I am currently engaged in and wish to delve deeper into, is at the intersection of environmental economics, trade, and urban economics. Within this domain, I utilize quantitative structural trade and urban models to investigate decentralized environmental regulation and the issue of carbon leakage. Work in this area includes my JMP titled "Spatial Equilibrium Analysis of Decentralized Carbon Regulation within a Country," where I developed an EK-type model. **My other research directions** include:

1. Assessing the policy impacts of environmental regulation using reduced-form frameworks and large datasets. A publication in this area is "Coordination or Contradiction: Evidence from Water and Air Pollution Regulation in China," where I employed a DID-based empirical strategy with firm-level data from China.
2. (Not currently pursuing) Developing models that integrate time series econometric methods with machine learning/deep learning models to forecast carbon/energy prices. A publication in this direction is "A Hybrid Model for Carbon Price Forecasting Using GARCH and Long Short-Term Memory Networks."

## Research Plans

I am currently working on and wish to further explore several research topics:

1. Expanding my JMP by refining the characterization of the electricity sector's production and trade behaviors, particularly the transportation of renewable energy across domestic regions, and determining optimal carbon regulation policies.
2. Examining firm dynamics, including market entry and exit, and relocation/site selection under asymmetric environmental regulations across regions, utilizing large databases such as firm registration data.
3. I am also interested in topics related to water pollution. Leveraging my experience in a coastal management project, I have conducted a series of cost-effectiveness studies on eutrophication control measures, such as fertilizer reduction.
